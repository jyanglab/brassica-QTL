# Project

This is an ongoing research project from Yang Lab. It was intended for internal lab usage. It has not been extensively tested. Use at your own risk.

To guide group members having a better sense about the project layout, here we briefly introduce the specific purposes of the [dir system](https://jyanglab.github.io/2017-01-07-project/). The layout of dirs is based on the idea borrowed from [ProjectTemplate](http://projecttemplate.net/architecture.html).
